# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard application that allows users to view the current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API for retrieving weather data and stores search history in `localStorage`.

## Usage
Users can search for a city to view its current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. The city is added to the search history, allowing users to quickly access weather information for previously searched cities. The app provides a clean and intuitive interface for planning trips or daily activities based on weather conditions.
